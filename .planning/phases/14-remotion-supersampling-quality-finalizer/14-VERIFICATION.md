    why_human: "Subjective visual quality — anti-aliasing perceptibility cannot be measured programmatically. The benchmark run could not assess this because benchmark.sh seeded a mismatched transcript (VID_20260518_114955) and omitted PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH, so rendered captions did not reflect studio config. This is a benchmark-setup limitation, not a pipeline defect."

# Phase 14: Remotion Supersampling + quality-finalizer Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Los subtítulos y overlays salen nítidos via render a 2x densidad de pixel, y la salida final sigue siendo 1080x1920 entregable via un nuevo step Docker quality-finalizer
**Verified:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (ROADMAP Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Subtitle text in final video is visually sharper than baseline (2x anti-aliasing perceptible) | ? UNCERTAIN | Subjective. Code path delivers scale:2→PNG→Lanczos (verified below), but visual comparison was not assessable in the benchmark run (mismatched transcript + no PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH). Routed to human end-to-end UAT. |
| 2 | remotion-renderer emits 2160x3840, quality-finalizer emits 1080x1920 | ✓ VERIFIED | Composition is 1080x1920 (Root.tsx:124-125) + `scale: remotionScale` (render.ts:324) with REMOTION_SCALE="2" (orchestrator.ts:105) → benchmark ffprobe: renderer=2160x3840, finalizer=1080x1920 (benchmark-result.txt M2/M3) |
| 3 | quality-finalizer is independent Docker container: INPUT (2160x3840) → OUTPUT (1080x1920) via Lanczos single encode, no existing-step changes | ✓ VERIFIED | services/quality-finalizer/Dockerfile + main.py + downscale.py present; single ffmpeg encode `scale=1080:1920:flags=lanczos,setsar=1` (downscale.py:103-125); additive STEPS entry (orchestrator.ts:110-118), no existing entries modified |
| 4 | scale:2 render time measured on representative clip; downgrade to scale:1.5 if over threshold, document final value | ✓ VERIFIED | Benchmark: 33min42s (2022s) on phase-13.mp4, well under 3h ceiling. scale:1.5 NOT needed; documented in 14-UAT.md + benchmark-result.txt M1 |
| 5 | A/V parity preserved in quality-finalizer output — duration & sync identical to input | ✓ VERIFIED | Audio `-c:a copy` (downscale.py:122); benchmark duration delta = 0.000s (16.533333s == 16.533333s) vs 33ms threshold (benchmark-result.txt M4) |

**Score:** 4/5 criteria verified; 1 (subjective sharpness) pending human UAT.

### Deferred Items

| # | Item | Addressed In | Evidence |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | color_primaries=bt709 / color_transfer=bt709 in H.264 SPS VUI | Tracked in deferred-items.md (Plan 14-03 D-11 partial) | downscale.py passes all 3 flags; H.264 only persists color_space. 1-line fix tracked. 14-02 must_have required only color_space, which PASSES. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| RENDER-01 | 14-01 | Remotion uses supersampling scale:2 for sharp subtitles/overlays | ✓ SATISFIED | render.ts scale param + REMOTION_SCALE="2"; renderer output 2160x3840 |
| RENDER-02 | 14-01 | Lossless PNG frame capture when supersampling | ✓ SATISFIED | render.ts imageFormat + REMOTION_IMAGE_FORMAT="png" wired |
| RENDER-03 | 14-02, 14-03 | New quality-finalizer step Lanczos-downscales 2160x3840→1080x1920 single final encode, output stays 9:16 1080x1920 | ✓ SATISFIED | Container + Lanczos single encode; benchmark 1080x1920 output |
| RENDER-04 | 14-03 | Render-time impact measured & acceptable (benchmark gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | 33min42s measured, under 3h ceiling, scale:1.5 not needed, documented |

All 4 declared requirement IDs (RENDER-01..04) are claimed by plans and accounted for. No orphaned requirements: REQUIREMENTS.md maps exactly RENDER-01..04 to Phase 14, all covered.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | — | No TBD/FIXME/XXX in modified files | ℹ️ Info | Clean |

Note: `npx tsc --noEmit` reports errors in render.ts (lines 313/323/339), Root.tsx, and api-server (artifacts.ts, batch.ts, status.ts, shared/schemas module resolution). These are PRE-EXISTING baseline errors (the `args` ChromiumOptions error and RemotionProps index-signature errors existed in the committed render.ts before Phase 14; the Phase 14 additions at lines 88-93/324-329/336 are NOT among the reported errors). Not a Phase 14 regression.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Subjective subtitle/overlay sharpness (Success Criterion #1)

**Test:** Run a real end-to-end pipeline job with a matching transcript and a studio-saved pipeline-config.json, then open `quality-finalizer/output.mp4` and compare subtitle/overlay edge sharpness against `.planning/phases/13-encode-quality/uat/baseline.mp4`.
**Expected:** Subtitle text and overlay edges visibly crisper / smoother anti-aliasing than the scale:1 baseline.
**Why human:** Anti-aliasing perceptibility is subjective and cannot be measured programmatically. The benchmark run used a mismatched transcript and skipped PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH, so its captions were not comparable to baseline (benchmark-setup limitation, not pipeline defect).

### Gaps Summary

No blocking gaps. The full scale:2 → PNG → Lanczos-downscale → 1080x1920 path is implemented, wired end-to-end (orchestrator + docker-compose), and confirmed by the orchestrator-run benchmark: renderer emits 2160x3840, quality-finalizer emits 1080x1920, A/V duration delta is 0.000s, color_space=bt709, and the scale:2 render (33min42s) is well under the 3h ceiling so no scale:1.5 downgrade was required. All 4 requirement IDs are satisfied.

Two items remain open but are NOT blockers:
1. **Success criterion #1 (subjective sharpness)** — genuinely requires a human visual judgment on a real end-to-end run. This drives the `human_needed` status.
2. **D-11 color_primaries/color_transfer** — a tracked 1-line ffmpeg follow-up; the Phase 14 must_have only required color_space (which passes), so this is deferred, not failed.
